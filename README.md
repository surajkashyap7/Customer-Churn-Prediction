## What is customer churn?
Customer churn is the percentage of customers that stopped using your company's product or service during a certain time frame. You can calculate churn rate by dividing the number of customers you lost during that time period -- say a quarter -- by the number of customers you had at the beginning of that time period.

For example, if you start your quarter with 400 customers and end with 380, your churn rate is 5% because you lost 5% of your customers.

## What is customer retention examples?
One of the most common customer retention examples is rewarding consumers. Rewards programs encourage customers to return by giving them discounts, exclusive access, or special offers.
